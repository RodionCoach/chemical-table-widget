The most important characteristic of a eukaryotic cell is the presence of a membrane-bound <span>nucleus</span> that contains the genetic information.</div></div><div data-page="3"><div id="unicellular"><span>Uni</span>cellular organisms are living organisms that are each composed of <span>one</span> single cell.</div><div id="multicellular"><span>Multi</span>cellular organisms are living organisms made of <span>many</span> cells.

These organisms must consume other organisms (either autotrophic or heterotrophic) to gain nutrients needed for survival.</div></div></div><script src="index.js"></script><script src="./service-worker-registration.js"></script></body></html>
